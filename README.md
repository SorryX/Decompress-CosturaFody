# Decompress-CosturaFody
<p>So, there is costura Fody which takes a dll and embeds it or whatever meaning it also get's compressed so if you look with dnspy
into a program and you see compressed dlls that you want, you wont be able to get them so this tool is here to help all it does is takes that compressed dll
and uses the same way costura fody decompresses it and gives you the original dll!</p>

<p>You can use this tool for other extensions meaning other then .dll</p>

## Anything required
Windows is required and updated windows
you probably can use linux and mac using .net core but i wont.
